# Temperature-And-pH-Indicator

This Was my College Minor Project Where I built a Temperature And pH Indicator For Industries.
Initially We Demonstrated This Project By Simply Using MatPlotLib And NumPy Random Function.
Later We Converted The Project To Physical Model Using Ardiuno.
This Project Is Quite Complex For Me As I Don't Have Expertise Knowledge In Ardiuno Coding.
In This Repository I will Provide Both ProtoType And Final Code.
This Project Is Short Yet Useful To Tackle Real-World Problems.
