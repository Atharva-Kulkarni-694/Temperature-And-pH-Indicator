# 🌡️💧 Temperature and pH Indicator

## 📖 Project Overview
Welcome to my **Temperature and pH Indicator 🚀**, a college minor project focused on **real-time industrial monitoring.**

This system helps track **temperature 🌡️ and pH 💧 levels** with alerts for unsafe thresholds.  
Initially, we created a **Python-based simulation 💻** using `NumPy` and `Matplotlib` 📊. Later, I built a **physical prototype ⚙️** using Arduino 🛠️.

As someone with limited Arduino experience, this project was both **challenging and rewarding 💪**. It’s a compact solution but with **real-world applications 🌍**.
